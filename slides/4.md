# Testing hooks

If you test _"implementation"_ instead of **"behavior"**, refactor using hooks will break tests. If you test behavior, React hooks is merely an implementation detail.

- functions or data bound to the class doesn't exist, e.g. `instance()` and `state()` can't be used
- mocks can still be used to simulate data and verify correct functions calls (don't test `handleClick` was click)

Check out "react-testing-library" to help enforce behavior testing: https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library

Example: `OnOffSwitch`.
