# What is a hook?

--

Implementation of _statefulness_ and _side effects_ in functional components.

--

1. useState is essentially a _closure_, namely:

> Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

--

2. useEffect handles _side effects_, define as:

--

> A side effect is any application state change that is observable outside the called function other than its return value.

Example: network requests, console logging, I/O operations...

```javascript
const useState = initialValue => {
  // Lexical scope
  let value = initialValue;
  const state = () => value; // closure
  const setState = newValue => {
    value = newValue; // closure
  };

  return [state, setState];
};

const [state, setState] = useState(0);
console.log(state); // 0
setState(1);
console.log(state); // 1
```

```javascript
const getMovies = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/movies.json');
  const movies = await res.json();
  return movies;
};
```
