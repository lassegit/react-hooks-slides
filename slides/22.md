# useEffect

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {}; // Clean up function
}, []);
```

- Using side effects aren't allowed inside React's _render phase_, as it leads to bugs/UI inconsistencies
- useEffect run after renders
- side effects in functional components must be executed here

--

> The question is not "when does this effect run" the question is "with which state does this effect synchronize with"

> - useEffect(fn) // all state
> - useEffect(fn, []) // no state
> - useEffect(fn, [these, states])

Example.

- Changing the thinking away from object orientated programming to functional programming:

```javascript
